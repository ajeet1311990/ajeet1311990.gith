Provisioning :- setup new server for production.
what is Docker and why come i market  :-  we can not run multiple application on single os that why we create multiple vm which is more costly
for the Organisation then docker come in market which we deploy on the single os without libary confilict it take name space in single os.
Docker architecture :- 
Docker Host  :-
Docker community :- Docker (CE,EE) , RedHat ( atomic host)
Docker Image :- it is the set of binary or libary file which run application.
   1) .  Micro Image
   2) . 
Docker image ragistory server is the refercen of docker image.
       docker.io
       rigstory.access.redhat.com
Docker contaner :- it is the running mod of docker image.
we can depoly multiple contner by using single image.

 Docker Installation & Manage Docker Images & continer Commands .
 yum update -y
yum install docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
docker images              [ check how many images in OS ]
docker ps                  [ how many contner running stage ]
docker ps -a               [ how many contner running and also stop mod ]
docker search nginx        [ search all image is i docker community ]
docker pull nginx          [ Download latest nginx version avalibaly in docker comminte ]
docker pull mysql:5.6      
docker pull centos         [ Download centos base image ]
How to deploy continer : -
we can depoly continer two type
1) service mode  o/r Deaman mode o/r Detach mode
2) instraction mode o/r root mode

docker run -it --name=con1 centos:latest
docker top con1         [check how many process running in the contner ]
 docker exec -it con2 /bin/bash   [ /bin/bash exectute new shell ]

A contner will always stop if any process not running in it.
docker attach con2       [ enter in docker contener if it is runing ]
ctrl+ps     [ also can exit without stop /bin/bash ]
docker stop con2
docker rm con1

How to depoly contner in damane mode.
 
 docker run -d --name mysql-con -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=redhat mysql:latest
docker ps
docker top mysql-con

we con not get terminal mod for mysql contner because it have not /bin/bash   but we can use it as DB server for loging ->
docker  exec -it mysql-con /bin/bash
mysql -u root -p                 [ for loging mysql]
docker stop mysql-con
docker rm mysql-con
