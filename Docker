Provisioning :- setup new server for production.
what is Docker and why come i market  :-  we can not run multiple application on single os that why we create multiple vm which is more costly
for the Organisation then docker come in market which we deploy on the single os without libary confilict it take name space in single os.
Docker architecture :- 
Docker Host  :-  users are docker host
Docker community :- Docker (CE,EE) , RedHat ( atomic host)
Docker Image :- it is the set of binary or libary file which run application.
   1) .  Micro Image
   2) . 
Docker image ragistory server is the refercen of docker image.
       docker.io
       rigstory.access.redhat.com
Docker contaner :- it is the running mod of docker image.
we can depoly multiple contner by using single image.

 Docker Installation & Manage Docker Images & continer Commands .
 yum update -y
yum install docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
docker images              [ check how many images in OS ]
docker ps                  [ how many contner running stage ]
docker ps -a               [ how many contner running and also stop mod ]
docker search nginx        [ search all image is i docker community ]
docker pull nginx          [ Download latest nginx version avalibaly in docker comminte ]
docker pull mysql:5.6      
docker pull centos         [ Download centos base image ]
How to deploy continer : -
we can depoly continer two type
1) service mode  o/r Deaman mode o/r Detach mode
2) instraction mode o/r root mode

docker run -it --name=con1 centos:latest
docker top con1         [check how many process running in the contner ]
 docker exec -it con2 /bin/bash   [ /bin/bash exectute new shell ]

A contner will always stop if any process not running in it.
docker start con2    [for start   stop contner]
docker attach con2       [ enter in docker contener if it is runing ]
ctrl+ps     [ also can exit without stop /bin/bash ]
docker stop con2
docker rm con1

How to depoly contner in damane mode.
 
 docker run -d --name mysql-con -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=redhat mysql:latest
docker ps
docker top mysql-con

we con not get terminal mod for mysql contner because it have not /bin/bash   but we can use it as DB server for loging ->
docker  exec -it mysql-con /bin/bash
mysql -u root -p                 [ for loging mysql]
docker stop mysql-con
docker rm mysql-con

 
docker rm $(docker ps -q -a)                [ for delete all contner in one time ]
docker stop $(docker ps -q -a)              [ stop all contener in one time ]
docker rm -f webserver                      [ delete contner is in running mode ]
docker rm  web                              [ delete cotener ]
docker  rmi 7645sdbb41c89(id)               [ delete image ]

Docker commit :- 

docker work like git  so if we want store some data in docker contner we have to commit this and it create new docker image whic have your data for this .
docker run -it --name con1 centos:latest
vi test
docker commit -m "file name" con1 centos:v1
docker images
docker stop cen1
docker rm cen1
docker run -it --name con2 centos:v1

How to  provision new image  [ httpd based software ]

docker run -it --name web centos:latest
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html/
echo helloworld > index.html
ls
docker commit -m "apache installed" web centos:httpd
docker images
docker history 40a7009fd45a

cat index.html
rpm -qa httpd
/usr/bin/httpd        [ for start httpd service in contenar ]
or
apachectl
For check  contner IP
yum install net-tools -y
ifconfig
curl 172.17.o.2

How to access contner from external network
 For use external network we have to bind contner port to base machin port ( Port fording )
     or 
without doing port forwording contner to base machin external traffic never come.

docker run -it -p 85:80 --name con1 centos:httpd
for check out side exit on base machin and run
netstat -tnlp | grep docker-proxy
docker ps
in URL copy pest base machin public IP : port  like
[ 13.223.124.94:85 ]     URL

how to loging docker cotner out side  { aagain do port forwordig for SSH }
docker run -it -p 24:22 --name remote-server centos:latest
 rpm -qa openssh-server
     yum install openssh-server -y
     rpm -qa openssh-server
     useradd ajeet
     passwd ajeet
     yum install passwd
     passwd ajeet
     /usr/sbin/sshd
     ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
     ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
     ssh-keygen -f  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
     /usr/sbin/sshd
on putty
 base machin publice ip   24 [port]
check how many port regrved for docker
netstat -tnlp | grep docker-proxy
How to provision new image from docker file
mkdir apache
cd apache
vi dockerfile
FROM    centos:latest
MAINTAINER      Ajeet@localhost
RUN     yum install httpd -y
ADD     http://www.krnetworkcloud.org/devops.php /root
COPY    index.html /var/www/html
ENV     port 80
EXPOSE  80
CMD     /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND


docker build -t centos:apache  .
docker image
docker run -dp --name=test centos:apache  ( it will port binding auto matice )
docker ps
curl localhost:32772--> difault port
we always build docker file for do provision i one time
Docker file parametar
FROM    
MAINTAINER      
RUN     
ADD     
COPY    
ENV     
EXPOSE  
CMD     
Docker volume :-    
docker run -d -v /home/ec2-user/apache/:/etc/abc/ --name=test1 centos:latest
